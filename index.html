      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Karl Nordgren. I am a student at the University of Brigham Young.
        I am studying Information Systems and I am currently in my second year.
        I am from Utah and I love to play video games and go hiking. I am also a huge fan of the Utah Jazz.
        I am typing this paragraph using autotype, because I think it is funny.
        I don't really watch the Jazz, but I do like to play basketball.
      </p>

        Also, I feel like bad about erasing the Latin text. I am sorry.
        I studied Latin in high school and I really enjoyed it. I am not sure why I am writing this.
        I am just trying to fill up space. I am not sure what else to write.
        I am just going to keep writing until I run out of things to say.
        Again, that was all autotype recommendations. I am awesome, and a pretty big deal.
